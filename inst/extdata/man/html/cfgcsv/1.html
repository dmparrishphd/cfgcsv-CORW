<h2>
                The cfgcsv File Format
</h2>
<h3>
                Description
</h3>
<p>
                Description of the cfgcsv file format.
</p>
<h3>
                Details
</h3>
<p>
                A cfgcsv file is a CSV file [<a href=
                "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt"
                >1</a>, <a href=
                "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">2</a>]
                that is interpreted in a specific manner.
</p>
<h4>
                Header
</h4>
<p>
                The file header must have as least as many
                fields as the record having the greatest
                number of fields.
</p>
<p>
                A record corresponds to a line or row of a CSV file.
</p>
<p>
                A fields correponds to a column of a CSV file.
</p>
<h4>
                Column 1
</h4>
<p>
                Column 1 is defines which records are to be
                grouped.  Records having the same value in
                Column 1 are considered to be grouped together.
</p>
<h4>
                Column 2
</h4>
<p>
                Column 2 is defines names to associate with the
                values interpreted from the cfgcsv file.
</p>
<p>
                There should be no duplication among matched
                pairs of Column 1 and Column 2 values. There is
                one exception: <code>"define"</code> may appear
                multiple times in Column 2 for the same Column-1
                value.
</p>
<h4>
                "define"
</h4>
<p>
                For a given group and record, when Column 2
                contains <code>"define"</code>, the value in
                Column 3 of the same record is associated with
                the value in Column 4 of the same record; Column
                3 and 4 of the record form a <a href=
                "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair"
                >name-value pair</a>.
                Elsewhere within the group, wherever the defined
                name occurs, it is replaced with the associated
                value.
</p>
<h4>
                Interpretation
</h4>
<p>
                Interpretation proceeds as if the following phases were carried out.
</p>
<h5>
                Phase 1: Grouping
</h5>
<p>
                The records are separated according to group,
                as specified by Column 1.
</p>
<h5>
                Phase 2: Resolution of Definitions
</h5>
<p>
                Within each group, any definitions are used to
                substitute for the names given in the
                non-<code>"define"</code> records.
</p>
<h5>
                Phase 3: Concatenation
</h5>
<p>
                Within each record, the values in Columns 3
                onward are concatenated.
</p>
<h3>
                Example
</h3>
<p>
                The CSV file
</p>
<pre>
"GROUP","NAME","A","B","C"
"ONE","define","part1","(text to replace part1)"
"ONE","foo","partA","/partB","/partC"
"ONE","bar","part1","/part2"
"TWO","define","part1","(text to replace part1 for group TWO)"
"TWO","foo","part1","/part2"
</pre>
<p>
                Is interpreted as two groups, named
                <code>"ONE"</code> and
                <code>"TWO"</code>.
</p>
<p>
                Group <code>"ONE"</code> has two values, named
                <code>"foo"</code> and <code>"bar"</code>.
</p>
<p>
                In Group <code>"ONE"</code>, the name
                <code>"foo"</code> is associated with the text
                <code>"partA/partB/partC"</code>. And the name
                <code>"bar"</code> is associated with the text
                <code>"(text to replace part1)/part2"</code>.
</p>
<p>
                Group <code>"TWO"</code> has one value, named
                <code>"foo"</code>. For group
                <code>"TWO"</code>, the name <code>"foo"</code>
                is associated with the text <code>"(text to
                replace part1 for group TWO)/part2"</code>.
